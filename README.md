2. git checkout <branch-name>: Switch to the new branch.

Using a branch:

1. Make changes and commit them to the branch.
2. Use git checkout to switch between branches.

Merging branches:

1. git checkout main (or the target branch).
2. git merge <branch-name>: Merge the changes from the branch into the target branch.
3. Resolve any conflicts, if necessary.
4. git commit to finalize the merge.

Typical workflow:

1. Create a new branch for a feature or fix.
2. Develop and commit changes on the branch.
3. Review and test the changes.
4. Merge the branch into the main branch (e.g., main or master).
5. Delete the feature branch.

Branching is crucial for collaborative development on GitHub because it:

1. Allows parallel development: Multiple developers can work on different features simultaneously.
2. Isolates changes: Changes are contained within a branch, reducing conflicts and errors.
